          1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting
          with the experience?
        </h3>
        <p class="orngTxt">
          The way the website expands, shifts and shrinks as you scroll was the
          first thing that caught my attention. Especially the large bold fonts
          and titles that populate the page.
        </p>

        <h3 class="grnTxt">
          2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
          your discrete actions.
        </h3>
        <p class="orngTxt">
          Quickly scrolling up and down, clicking the sound on button, reading
          articles, looking at and listening to videos, scrolling past elements
          to hear the sound fade in and out, listening to the audio blend into
          each other, clicking the menu and pressing the buttons to navigate to
          different parts of the page.
        </p>

        <h3 class="grnTxt">
          3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
          with?
        </h3>
        <p class="orngTxt">
          The changing of audio and movement of visual elements is the part of
          the site I engaged with the most. The way text expanded and shrunk,
          and the way the audio quickly faded in and out at certain points was
          by far the most intriguing part of the page.

          4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with
          the experience?
        </h3>
        <p class="grnTxt">
          Scrolling was the most common action I took while navigating this
          website, as almost all of its interactivity, flair and stylisation
          come from the user scrolling through the site.
        </p>

        <h3 class="orngTxt">
          5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
          interactive experience?
        </h3>
        <p class="grnTxt">
          The intended primary goal of this interactive experience is to inform
          the user about Frank Gehry’s work on the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
          Conveying his thoughts, the design process and the intended experience
          of the hall.
        </p>

        <h3 class="orngTxt">
          6) How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
        </h3>
        <p class="grnTxt">
          The interactive experience shows the viewer videos of Gehry explaining
          his thought process, photos of the design process from concept to
          production, and supporting text to further convey these ideas.
          Additionally, the heavy stylisation supports the positive views on
          Gehry and his work, presenting the work in a stylish manner, further
          improving the viewer’s view of Gehry’s work and style.

          7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
          with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
        </h3>
        <p class="orngTxt">
          My impression of the intended “first time experience” is that the
          website should be taken in slowly, with the user slowly scrolling,
          watching the videos, reading through the text and absorbing all the
          information presented to them. However, the website can become
          annoying to navigate on proceeding visits, as a lot of scrolling is
          needed to get to later parts of the site. The designer of the site
          thought of this issue though and added an index which allows users to
          jump to later parts of the site instantly.
        </p>

        <h3 class="grnTxt">
          8) How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
          interacted with over time?
        </h3>
        <p class="orngTxt">
          While the site does have a small label at the beginning, informing
          users to “Scroll for Story”, viewers will likely naturally scroll down
          the site due to the lack of information at the start. Immediately, the
          size of the large, bold title “Sculpting Harmony” extends to fill the
          whole screen, this immediately informs the viewer of the behaviours of
          the page and how the website will respond to their input. This is then
          reinforced by the video of the concert hall itself, with the video and
          text only progressing when the user scrolls further.

          9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
          reference?
        </h3>
        <p class="grnTxt">
          This experience also utilises video and audio works to enhance the
          presentation and messages of the page. This includes the musical
          nature of Gehry’s work, or just as a more effective method of
          conveying the process of making the concert hall.
        </p>

        <h3 class="orngTxt">
          10) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
          act when engaging with your research experience?
        </h3>
        <p class="grnTxt">
          Both of these elements reinforce the interactivity of the site, as
          they also tie themselves to the scrolling feature. Audio will play for
          certain chapters, fading in and out or changing songs as you progress
          down the page. Videos will only progress as you scroll, such as the
          first aerial shots of the concert hall or will only play/ show when
          stopped at a certain point on the site, such as the video of Gehry
          talking about the miniature model of the hall.
        </p>

        <h3 class="orngTxt">
          11) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
          feel when engaging with your research experience?
        </h3>
        <p class="grnTxt">
          The audio adds a lot of intrigue to the site, and adds to the grand,
          orchestral nature of the concert hall being built. Additionally, on
          top of providing more information, the videos add much more visual
          intrigue to a site which would otherwise mostly be colour blocks and
          text. Both of these elements, and the emotional response they evoke
          make the page far more interesting to experience and scroll through,
          and in turn much more engaging.

          12) What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and
          what makes that part frustrating?
        </h3>
        <p class="orngTxt">
          Scrolling tends to be an imprecise motion or mode of control. This
          fact occasionally works against the main gimmick of this site, as
          relevant elements may be partially off screen when you pause to take
          in information, or the interviews with Gehry only play when at a very
          specific point on screen. Both of these issues require you to readjust
          the screen, scrolling a little bit up and down, which can become
          obnoxious, and detracts from the smooth presentation of the site.
        </p>
        <h3 class="grnTxt">
          13) What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and
          what makes that part satisfying?
        </h3>
        <p class="orngTxt">
          The most satisfying part of this experience is the scrolling. The site
          is built around this idea, with visual elements expanding, sliding,
          growing and shrinking, and audio fading or crosscutting. This, as well
          as the use of animation during scrolling, makes the site feel buttery
          smooth, sleek and modern, conveying a strong sense of style and
          character.
