        <h3>
          1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting
          with the experience?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The way the website expands, shifts and shrinks as you scroll was the
          first thing that caught my attention. Especially the large bold fonts
          and titles that populate the page.
        </p>

        <h3>
          2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
          your discrete actions.
        </h3>
        <p>
          Quickly scrolling up and down, clicking the sound on button, reading
          articles, looking at and listening to videos, scrolling past elements
          to hear the sound fade in and out, listening to the audio blend into
          each other, clicking the menu and pressing the buttons to navigate to
          different parts of the page.
        </p>

        <h3>
          3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
          with?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The changing of audio and movement of visual elements is the part of
          the site I engaged with the most. The way text expanded and shrunk,
          and the way the audio quickly faded in and out at certain points was
          by far the most intriguing part of the page.
        </p>

    <h3>
      4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the
      experience?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Scrolling was the most common action I took while navigating this website,
      as almost all of its interactivity, flair and stylisation come from the
      user scrolling through the site.
    </p>

    <h3>
      5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive
      experience?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The intended primary goal of this interactive experience is to inform the
      user about Frank Gehry’s work on the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Conveying
      his thoughts, the design process and the intended experience of the hall.
    </p>

    <h3>
      6) How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The interactive experience shows the viewer videos of Gehry explaining his
      thought process, photos of the design process from concept to production,
      and supporting text to further convey these ideas. Additionally, the heavy
      stylisation supports the positive views on Gehry and his work, presenting
      the work in a stylish manner, further improving the viewer’s view of
      Gehry’s work and style.
    </p>

    <h3>
      7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with
      over time? (For how long and how many different times)
    </h3>
    <p>
      My impression of the intended “first time experience” is that the website
      should be taken in slowly, with the user slowly scrolling, watching the
      videos, reading through the text and absorbing all the information
      presented to them. However, the website can become annoying to navigate on
      proceeding visits, as a lot of scrolling is needed to get to later parts
      of the site. The designer of the site thought of this issue though and
      added an index which allows users to jump to later parts of the site
      instantly.
    </p>

    <h3>
      8) How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
      interacted with over time?
    </h3>
    <p>
      While the site does have a small label at the beginning, informing users
      to “Scroll for Story”, viewers will likely naturally scroll down the site
      due to the lack of information at the start. Immediately, the size of the
      large, bold title “Sculpting Harmony” extends to fill the whole screen,
      this immediately informs the viewer of the behaviours of the page and how
      the website will respond to their input. This is then reinforced by the
      video of the concert hall itself, with the video and text only progressing
      when the user scrolls further.
    </p>

    <h3>
      9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
      reference?
    </h3>
    <p>
      This experience also utilises video and audio works to enhance the
      presentation and messages of the page. This includes the musical nature of
      Gehry’s work, or just as a more effective method of conveying the process
      of making the concert hall.
    </p>

    <h3>
      10) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act
      when engaging with your research experience?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Both of these elements reinforce the interactivity of the site, as they
      also tie themselves to the scrolling feature. Audio will play for certain
      chapters, fading in and out or changing songs as you progress down the
      page. Videos will only progress as you scroll, such as the first aerial
      shots of the concert hall or will only play/ show when stopped at a
      certain point on the site, such as the video of Gehry talking about the
      miniature model of the hall.
    </p>

    <h3>
      11) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
      feel when engaging with your research experience?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The audio adds a lot of intrigue to the site, and adds to the grand,
      orchestral nature of the concert hall being built. Additionally, on top of
      providing more information, the videos add much more visual intrigue to a
      site which would otherwise mostly be colour blocks and text. Both of these
      elements, and the emotional response they evoke make the page far more
      interesting to experience and scroll through, and in turn much more
      engaging.
    </p>

    <h3>
      12) What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
      makes that part frustrating?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Scrolling tends to be an imprecise motion or mode of control. This fact
      occasionally works against the main gimmick of this site, as relevant
      elements may be partially off screen when you pause to take in
      information, or the interviews with Gehry only play when at a very
      specific point on screen. Both of these issues require you to readjust the
      screen, scrolling a little bit up and down, which can become obnoxious,
      and detracts from the smooth presentation of the site.
    </p>

    <h3>
      13) What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
      makes that part satisfying?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The most satisfying part of this experience is the scrolling. The site is
      built around this idea, with visual elements expanding, sliding, growing
      and shrinking, and audio fading or crosscutting. This, as well as the use
      of animation during scrolling, makes the site feel buttery smooth, sleek
      and modern, conveying a strong sense of style and character.
