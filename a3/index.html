       look shiny or even metal, as art gallery plaques tend to be on shiny acrylic or metal. The seriff type used
       (much like the use of grand piano sounds) not only aligns with typical plaque formatting, but also further

          Vincent Van Gogh <br />
          <i>The Starry Night</i>, 1889
        </h1>
        <p>Oil on Canvas</p>
        <p>
          The Starry Night, often called simply Starry Night, is an
          oil-on-canvas painting by the Dutch Post-Impressionist painter Vincent
          van Gogh. Painted in June 1889, it depicts the view from the
          east-facing window of his asylum room at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, just
          before sunrise, with the addition of an imaginary village. It has been
          in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York
          City since 1941, acquired through the Lillie P. Bliss Bequest.
          Described as a "touchstone of modern art", The Starry Night has been
          regarded as one of the most recognizable paintings in the Western
          canon.
        </p>
        <p>
          The painting was created in mid-June 1889, inspired by the view from
          Van Gogh’s bedroom window at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum. The
          former monastery functioned as a mental asylum, where Van Gogh
          voluntarily admitted himself on 8 May 1889, following a mental
          breakdown and his infamous act of self-mutilation that occurred in
          late December 1888. Catering to wealthy patients, the facility was
          less than half full at the time of Van Gogh's admission, allowing the
          artist access to both a second-story bedroom and a ground-floor
          studio. During his year-long stay, he remained highly productive,
          creating Irises, a self-portrait, and The Starry Night.

        <p>Tempera on Canvas</p>
        <p>
          The Birth of Venus is a painting by the Italian artist Sandro
          Botticelli, probably executed in the mid-1480s. It depicts the goddess
          Venus arriving at the shore after her birth, when she had emerged from
          the sea fully-grown (called Venus Anadyomene and often depicted in
          art). The painting is in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy. <br />
          <br />
          Although the two are not a pair, the painting is inevitably discussed
          with Botticelli's other very large mythological painting, the
          Primavera, also in the Uffizi. They are among the most famous
          paintings in the world, and icons of Italian Renaissance painting; of
          the two, the Birth is better known than the Primavera. As depictions
          of subjects from classical mythology on a very large scale they were
          virtually unprecedented in Western art since classical antiquity, as
          was the size and prominence of a nude female figure in the Birth. It
          used to be thought that they were both commissioned by the same member
          of the Medici family, but this is now uncertain.

        <p>Oil on Canvas</p>
        <p>
          Guernica is a large 1937 oil painting by Spanish artist Pablo Picasso.
          It is one of his best-known works, regarded by many art critics as the
          most moving and powerful anti-war painting in history. It is exhibited
          in the Museo Reina Sofía in Madrid.<br /><br />
          The grey, black, and white painting, on a canvas 3.49 meters (11 ft 5
          in) tall and 7.76 meters (25 ft 6 in) across, portrays the suffering
          wrought by violence and chaos. Prominently featured in the composition
          are a gored horse, a bull, screaming women, a dead baby, a dismembered
          soldier, and flames. <br />
          <br />
          Picasso painted Guernica at his home in Paris in response to the 26
          April 1937 bombing of Guernica, a town in the Basque Country in
          northern Spain, by Nazi Germany's Condor Legion and Fascist Italy.
          Upon completion, Guernica was exhibited at the Spanish pavilion at the
          1937 Paris International Exposition and then at other venues around
          the world. The touring exhibition was used to raise funds for Spanish
          war relief. The painting soon became widely acclaimed, helping to
          bring worldwide attention to the Spanish Civil War that took place
          from 1936 to 1939.

        <h1>Gustav Klimt<br /><i>The Kiss</i>, 1907-1908</h1>
        <p>Oil and Gold Leaf on Canvas</p>
        <p>
          The Kiss is an oil-on-canvas painting with added gold leaf, silver and
          platinum by the Austrian Symbolist painter Gustav Klimt. It was
          painted at some point in 1907 and 1908, during the height of what
          scholars call his "Golden Period". It was exhibited in 1908 under the
          title Liebespaar (the lovers) as stated in the catalogue of the
          exhibition. The painting depicts a couple embracing each other, their
          bodies entwined in elaborate robes decorated in a style influenced by
          the contemporary Art Nouveau style and the organic forms of the
          earlier Arts and Crafts movement.<br /><br />
          The painting now hangs in the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere museum
          in the Upper Belvedere Palace in Vienna, and is considered a
          masterpiece of Vienna Secession – the local variation of Art Nouveau –
          and probably Klimt's most important work. <br /><br />
          Love, intimacy, and sexuality are common themes found in Gustav
          Klimt's works.[citation needed] The Stoclet Frieze and the Beethoven
          Frieze are such examples of Klimt's focus on romantic intimacy. Both
          works are precursors to The Kiss and feature the recurring motif of an
          embracing couple.
