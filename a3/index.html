          Vincent Van Gogh <br />
          The Starry Night, 1889
        </h1>
        <p>Oil on Canvas</p>
        <p>
          The Starry Night, often called simply Starry Night, is an
          oil-on-canvas painting by the Dutch Post-Impressionist painter Vincent
          van Gogh. Painted in June 1889, it depicts the view from the
          east-facing window of his asylum room at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, just
          before sunrise, with the addition of an imaginary village. It has been
          in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York
          City since 1941, acquired through the Lillie P. Bliss Bequest.
          Described as a "touchstone of modern art", The Starry Night has been
          regarded as one of the most recognizable paintings in the Western
          canon.

          The painting was created in mid-June 1889, inspired by the view from
          Van Gogh’s bedroom window at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum. The
          former monastery functioned as a mental asylum, where Van Gogh
          voluntarily admitted himself on 8 May 1889, following a mental
          breakdown and his infamous act of self-mutilation that occurred in
          late December 1888. Catering to wealthy patients, the facility was
          less than half full at the time of Van Gogh's admission, allowing the
          artist access to both a second-story bedroom and a ground-floor
          studio. During his year-long stay, he remained highly productive,
          creating Irises, a self-portrait, and The Starry Night.

        <h1>Sandro Botticelli <br />The Birth of Venus, 1484-1489</h1>
        <p>Tempera on Canvas</p>
        <p>
          The Birth of Venus is a painting by the Italian artist Sandro
          Botticelli, probably executed in the mid-1480s. It depicts the goddess
          Venus arriving at the shore after her birth, when she had emerged from
          the sea fully-grown (called Venus Anadyomene and often depicted in
          art). The painting is in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy. <br />
          Although the two are not a pair, the painting is inevitably discussed
          with Botticelli's other very large mythological painting, the
          Primavera, also in the Uffizi. They are among the most famous
          paintings in the world, and icons of Italian Renaissance painting; of
          the two, the Birth is better known than the Primavera. As depictions
          of subjects from classical mythology on a very large scale they were
          virtually unprecedented in Western art since classical antiquity, as
          was the size and prominence of a nude female figure in the Birth. It
          used to be thought that they were both commissioned by the same member
          of the Medici family, but this is now uncertain.
